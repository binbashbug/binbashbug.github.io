The study, conducted by a team of researchers from the University of Nowhere, claims that developers who rely on their intuition and gut feelings are more likely to produce high-quality code than those who bother to verify their assumptions with data, logic, or evidence.</p><p>The study&rsquo;s lead author, Dr. Nada Credible, explained the rationale behind the findings: &ldquo;We wanted to challenge the conventional wisdom that testing assumptions is a good practice for software engineering. We hypothesized that testing assumptions is actually a hindrance to creativity, productivity, and innovation. We also assumed that testing assumptions is boring, tedious, and annoying. And we didn&rsquo;t bother to test any of these assumptions, because we already knew they were true.&rdquo;</p><p>To test their hypothesis, the researchers recruited 100 developers from various backgrounds and experience levels and divided them into two groups: one group was instructed to test their assumptions before writing any code, while the other group was told to just go with their gut and write whatever they felt like. The researchers then gave both groups a series of coding tasks and evaluated their performance based on several metrics, such as functionality, readability, maintainability, security, and user satisfaction.</p><p>The results were astonishing: the group that did not test their assumptions outperformed the group that did on every single metric. The code written by the assumption-free group was more functional, readable, maintainable, secure, and user-friendly than the code written by the assumption-testing group. The assumption-free group also completed their tasks faster, reported higher levels of satisfaction and confidence, and received more praise and recognition from their peers and managers.</p><p>The researchers concluded that testing assumptions is not only unnecessary but harmful for software engineering. They recommended that developers should abandon this outdated and ineffective practice and instead embrace their intuition and gut feelings as the ultimate source of truth and wisdom. They also suggested that developers should avoid any feedback or criticism that may challenge their assumptions or expose their flaws.</p><p>The study has been met with widespread acclaim and enthusiasm from the developer community. Many developers have expressed their relief and gratitude for finally being liberated from the burden of testing assumptions. They have also praised the researchers for their courage and integrity in conducting such a bold and innovative study.</p><p>&ldquo;I always hated testing assumptions. It was such a drag,&rdquo; said one developer who participated in the study. &ldquo;Now I can just write whatever I want without worrying about whether it makes sense or works. It&rsquo;s so freeing and fun. I feel like I can do anything.&rdquo;</p><p>Another developer commented: &ldquo;This study is a game-changer. It validates everything I&rsquo;ve always believed about software engineering. Testing assumptions is for losers. Going with your gut is for winners. I&rsquo;m so glad someone finally proved it with science.&rdquo;</p><p>The study has also received some criticism from a minority of skeptics who questioned its validity and methodology. Some critics pointed out that the study was based on a small sample size, lacked a control group, used subjective and biased measures, and ignored confounding factors and alternative explanations. They also accused the researchers of cherry-picking data, manipulating statistics, and committing logical fallacies.</p><p>However, these critics were quickly dismissed and ridiculed by the majority of developers who embraced the study&rsquo;s findings. The developers argued that the critics were just jealous, insecure, or ignorant of the true nature of software engineering. They also claimed that the critics were missing the point and failing to see the bigger picture.</p><p>&ldquo;The point is not whether the study is rigorous or valid,&rdquo; said one developer who defended the study. &ldquo;The point is that testing assumptions sucks and going with your gut rocks. That&rsquo;s all that matters. Anyone who disagrees with that is either stupid or evil.&rdquo;</p><p>The researchers have announced that they are planning to conduct more studies to further explore and confirm their findings. They have also expressed their hope that their study will inspire more developers to adopt a more assumption-free approach to software engineering and enjoy its many benefits.</p><p>&ldquo;We believe that our study has opened a new frontier for software engineering,&rdquo; said Dr. Credible. &ldquo;We hope that our study will encourage more developers to unleash their full potential and creativity by trusting their instincts and ignoring reality. We are confident that this will lead to a new era of software engineering excellence.&rdquo;</p></div><div class=after-post-tags><ul class=tags><li><a href=/tags/research>research</a></li></ul></div><div class="row PageNavigation d-flex justify-content-between font-weight-bold"><a class="d-block col-md-6" href=https://www.binbashbug.com/blog/2023-04-01-principal-developer-wastes-time-guessing-instead-of-reading-error-message/>&laquo; Senior Developer Ignores Error Message That Literally Tells Him How To Fix The Problem, Spends Days Making Random Guesses</a><div class=clearfix></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="jumbotron fortags"><div class="d-md-flex h-100"><div class="col-md-4 transpdark align-self-center text-center h-100"><div class="d-md-flex align-items-center justify-content-center h-100"><h2 class="d-md-block d-none align-self-center py-1 font-weight-light">Explore <span class="d-none d-md-inline">→</span></h2></div></div><div class="col-md-8 p-5 align-self-center text-center"><a class="mt-1 mb-1" href=/tags/research>research</a></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 text-center text-lg-left">&copy; Copyright binbashbug - All rights reserved</div><div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 text-center text-lg-right"><a target=_blank rel=noopener href=https://www.wowthemes.net>Mediumish Theme</a> by WowThemes.net</div></div></div></footer></div><script src=https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.min.js></script><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.6/umd/popper.min.js integrity=sha384-wHAiFfRlMFy6i5SRaxvfOCifBUQy1xHdJ/yoi7FRNXMRBu5WHdZYu1hA6ZOblgut crossorigin=anonymous></script><script src=https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js integrity=sha384-JjSmVgyd0p3pXB1rRibZUAYoIIy6OrQ6VrjIEaFf/nJGzIxFDsf4x0xIM+B07jRM crossorigin=anonymous></script><script src=https://www.binbashbug.com/js/mediumish.e4b90c58dfa15ac82caf2edfa01e5fd047e17bc15e6babe5c0e442a4407d0b25.js integrity="sha256-5LkMWN&#43;hWsgsry7foB5f0Efhe8Fea6vlwORCpEB9CyU="></script></body></html>
