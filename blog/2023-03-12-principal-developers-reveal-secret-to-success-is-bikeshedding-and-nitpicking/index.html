                        <p>Principal developers, the highest-ranking and most respected developers in the industry, have revealed their secrets to effective code review: nitpick and bikeshed everything. According to these experts, the best way to ensure code quality and maintainability is to focus on the smallest and most irrelevant details of the code and ignore the bigger and more important issues.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nitpicking and bikeshedding are the essence of code review,&rdquo; said Diane Evans, a principal developer at a leading tech company. &ldquo;They show that you care about the code and that you have high standards. They also show that you have superior knowledge and skills than the author of the code. That&rsquo;s why I always leave at least 27 comments on every code review request, pointing out every single indentation issue, spelling mistake, variable name, or comment style. I also make sure to argue endlessly about these issues until the author agrees with me or gives up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Evans added that she never bothers to look at the logic, functionality, or security of the code, as those are not her concern. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the job of the author, not the reviewer,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;My job is to make sure that the code looks good and follows the best practices and conventions that I have established. I don&rsquo;t care if the code works or not, as long as it&rsquo;s indented properly and has consistent naming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another principal developer, Andy Horn, agreed with Evans and shared his own tips for effective code review. &ldquo;One of my favorite techniques is to bikeshed every single decision that the author has made,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I question everything: why did they use this framework? Why did they use this algorithm? Why did they use this color? Why did they use this font? I make them justify every single choice they have made and then I tell them why they are wrong and why they should do it my way instead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Horn explained that bikeshedding is a great way to demonstrate his authority and expertise as a principal developer. &ldquo;It shows that I have a broader and deeper understanding of the problem domain and the solution space than the author,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It also shows that I have a better taste and aesthetic sense than them. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if their choices are reasonable or valid, as long as they are different from mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Horn added that he also likes to nitpick and bikeshed other reviewers&rsquo; comments as well, to show that he is superior to them too. &ldquo;I always reply to every comment that someone else has left on a code review request, either agreeing with them or disagreeing with them,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If I agree with them, I restate their point in my own words and add some extra details or examples to show that I know more than them. If I disagree with them, I explain why they are wrong and why my opinion is better. I also make sure to use a lot of technical jargon and acronyms to show that I am smarter than them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both Evans and Horn said that they are very proud of their code review skills and that they have received a lot of praise and recognition for them. They also said that they have never encountered any major problems or issues with their code or their projects, as they always pass all the tests and meet all the requirements.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are confident that our code review approach is the best one for software engineering,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;We believe that nitpicking and bikeshedding are not only effective but essential for ensuring code quality and maintainability. We encourage all developers to follow our example and adopt our methods. Trust us, we are principal developers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, their confidence was shattered when</p>
